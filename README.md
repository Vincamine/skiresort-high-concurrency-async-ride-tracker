# ⚙️ Technical Overview of the Ski Data Processing System

This system is designed to handle **high-throughput, low-latency processing** of skier lift ride data using a **modular and scalable architecture**. It supports both large-scale data ingestion (**POST**) and efficient query retrieval (**GET**), optimized for **concurrent workloads**.

---

## 🧱 Architecture Components

- **Client1 / Client2**  
  Generate and send up to 200,000 lift ride events using multithreaded API clients. Client2 additionally logs latency, status, and throughput metrics.

- **Server (Servlet-based)**  
  Handles RESTful POST/GET requests. Writes go through RabbitMQ; reads are served via Redis cache.

- **RabbitMQ (Message Queue)**  
  Asynchronous decoupling between ingestion and processing layers.

- **Consumer**  
  Pulls messages from RabbitMQ, parses data, and stores results in Redis using a thread pool and asynchronous processing.

## 🛠️ Core Technologies & Techniques

- **Concurrency**
  - `ExecutorService` and `CompletableFuture` ensure scalable multithreading.
  - `ConcurrentHashMap` for safe, shared-memory operations.

- **Redis**
  - Used as an in-memory cache to reduce latency and offload read-heavy traffic.
  - Data structures include Hashes (per-skier stats), Sets (unique skiers), optimized with precomputed fields and TTLs.

- **RabbitMQ**
  - Enables high-throughput message queuing between API and consumer layers.
  - Custom channel pooling to reduce connection overhead.

- **Performance Testing**
  - JMeter used for simulating 128 threads × 500 iterations (64,000+ GET requests).
  - System supports ~2,965 requests/sec with <30ms average response time.

## 📈 Optimization Strategies

- **Redis Read Replicas**  
  Offload heavy read traffic.

- **Redis Cluster**  
  Enables automatic key sharding across multiple nodes.

- **Hot Key Sharding**  
  Hash-based key splitting for load balancing.

- **Hot/Cold Data Separation**  
  Redis used for active (“hot”) data; MySQL planned for persistent storage of inactive (“cold”) data.
